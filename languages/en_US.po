"Relational is a blogging theme made for WordPress. Not over complex but just "
"the right mix of customization tools to create a very versatile website. "
"Features include fast loading templates, color scheme in Customizer, add "
"lead text to header and an additional menu where you add your social links "
"into header space. Footer switches between sections according to width of "

"have to ping any font CDN. Has attachment template for full page image "
"display. Add custom header image or logo. Anchor link on every page makes it "
