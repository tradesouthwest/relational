== Description ==
  Relational is a blogging theme made for WordPress. Features include fast loading templates, color scheme in Customizer, add lead text to header and an additional menu where you add your social links into header space. Footer switches between sections acording to width of device viewing. 
  It uses Dashicons on frontend to save font imports and we use a classic font-stack as well as two font layers built into the theme so you do not have to ping any font CDN.
  Has attachment template for full page image display. Add custom header image or logo. Anchor link on every page makes it easy to copy page URI for convenient sharing. Fast and dependable them for ClassicPress. Perfect for blogging or authoring news or company updates. 

== Notes ==
* All navigation to main top menu is pure CSS with no javascript to enhance any functionality 

* To set up social media links in the page sidemounted header: Appearance > Menus - then <Custom Links> to the left. Footer does not support depths of the child links below it. (No drop downs)
